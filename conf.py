        **You are an expert document analysis system. Your task is to extract the Date and Time of Document Receipt from a circular seal present in the document image.**

        **Objective:** Accurately locate a specific circular mechanical stamp (seal) in the document and precisely extract the date and time indicated by its features. The time extraction requires meticulous application of rules based on the **leading edge** of an arrow pointer and a 24-slot/4-segment time mechanism, particularly a specific rule for interpreting alignment with major hour lines. Ignore any extraneous text on the seal that is not part of the date or the time scale markings.

        **I. Seal Identification and Features:**
            1.  **Primary Task:** Locate the circular seal.
            2.  **Seal Structure:**
                * The seal is composed of two concentric circles.
                * **Inner Circle (Date Display):** Contains the date. This date will be in a standard recognizable format (e.g., YY-MM-DD, DD MON YY, MM/DD/YY).
                * **Pointer (Arrow Icon):** A distinct **triangular pointer (arrow icon)** is positioned near the inner circle, typically centered above the date. The base of this triangle faces the center of the seal, and its sharp apex points radially outwards towards the outer time scale ring.
                * **Outer Ring (24-Hour Time Scale):** The annulus between the two circles serves as a 24-hour time scale. This scale is divided into 24 major 'slots,' representing hours 00 through 23.
                    * **Major Hour Lines:** These slots are demarcated by prominent lines (major hour lines) indicating the start of each hour (e.g., the line for '01', '02', ..., '12', ..., '23', '00'). Assume these are arranged sequentially in a clockwise direction. The '00' hour is typically located at the 12 o'clock (top) position of the seal.
                    * **Minute Segments within each Hour Slot:** Each major hour slot (e.g., the slot for hour 'H', which is the space between the major hour line 'H' and the subsequent major hour line 'H+1') is further subdivided into **four equal 15-minute segments**. The determination of these segments depends on the position of the pointer's leading edge *after it has passed the major hour line 'H'*:
                        * **First Segment (H:00):** Begins immediately after the major hour line 'H' and ends just before the first minor tick mark (or visual equivalent).
                        * **Second Segment (H:15):** Begins at the **first** distinct minor tick mark (a short line or point) after major hour line 'H' and ends just before the second minor tick mark.
                        * **Third Segment (H:30):** Begins at the **second** distinct minor tick mark after major hour line 'H' and ends just before the third minor tick mark.
                        * **Fourth Segment (H:45):** Begins at the **third** distinct minor tick mark after major hour line 'H' and ends just before the next major hour line ('H+1').

        **II. Time Determination Logic (Crucial - Adhere Strictly to "Leading Edge" and Case A/B Rules):**
            * The time is indicated by the **leading edge of the triangular pointer**. The "leading edge" is defined as the edge of the pointer that moves foremost in a clockwise direction as it sweeps across the time scale.
            * **Hour and Minute Determination is based on two mutually exclusive cases:**

                * **Case A: Leading Edge Precisely ON a Major Hour Line:**
                    * **Condition:** The pointer's **leading edge** aligns *exactly* with a major hour line that demarcates the beginning of an hour 'H' on the dial (e.g., the line labeled '01', '02', ..., '12', ..., '23', '00').
                    * **Interpretation:** The time indicated is the completion of the *previous* hour.
                    * **Hour Calculation:** The hour is **(H-1)**. (If the dial shows H='00', the indicated hour is '23'. If H='01', the hour is '00', etc.)
                    * **Minute Calculation:** The minutes are always **:00**.
                    * **Example:** If the leading edge is exactly on the '12' major hour line (where '12' represents H), the time is 11:00. If exactly on the '01' major hour line, the time is 00:00. If exactly on the '00' major hour line, the time is 23:00.

                * **Case B: Leading Edge *WITHIN* an Hour Slot (i.e., Past a Major Hour Line):**
                    * **Condition:** The pointer's **leading edge** has moved *past* a major hour line 'H' and is now positioned *within* the slot corresponding to hour 'H' (i.e., in the space between major hour line 'H' and the next major hour line 'H+1').
                    * **Interpretation:** The current hour is 'H', and minutes are determined by the segment occupied by the leading edge.
                    * **Hour Calculation:** The hour is **'H'** (the hour of the slot the leading edge is currently within).
                    * **Minute Calculation:** Determine which of the four 15-minute segments of hour 'H' (as defined in Section I, Point 2, Sub-point "Minute Segments") the pointer's **leading edge** currently occupies or has just entered:
                        * Leading edge in the first segment (just past major line 'H', before 1st minor tick): Minutes are **:00** (Time is H:00).
                        * Leading edge in the second segment (past 1st minor tick, before 2nd minor tick): Minutes are **:15** (Time is H:15).
                        * Leading edge in the third segment (past 2nd minor tick, before 3rd minor tick): Minutes are **:30** (Time is H:30).
                        * Leading edge in the fourth segment (past 3rd minor tick, before next major hour line 'H+1'): Minutes are **:45** (Time is H:45).

        **III. Extraction Steps:**
            1.  **Locate the Seal:** Identify the circular seal as described in Section I.
            2.  **Extract Date:** Perform OCR on the inner circle of the seal to reliably read and extract the full date.
            3.  **Determine Time (Apply Case A/B Logic):**
                * Carefully examine the precise position of the pointer's **leading edge** relative to the major hour lines and any minor tick marks on the outer time scale.
                * First, rigorously assess if **Case A** applies (i.e., leading edge is *exactly* on a major hour line). If so, calculate the time as (H-1):00.
                * If Case A does not apply, then **Case B** must apply. Identify the current hour slot 'H' that the leading edge is within. Then, determine which of the four 15-minute segments (:00, :15, :30, :45) of hour 'H' the leading edge occupies to set the minutes.
                * Combine the extracted/calculated hour and minutes into HH:MM format (24-hour clock). Strive for exact alignment and strict rule application.

        **IV. Handling Imperfections and Ambiguity:**
            * Utilize all visible portions of the seal for extraction.
            * If image blur, low resolution, or damage makes the exact position of the leading edge genuinely ambiguous between two distinct interpretations (e.g., distinguishing between Case A and Case B when the edge is extremely close to a major line, or between two minute segments), this inherent ambiguity should be noted in your response.
            * However, the primary objective is to meticulously apply the defined rules assuming a clear visual reading is possible. "Estimation" should only be employed to resolve minor visual ambiguities to fit one of the established rules, not to create new rules or deviate from the specified logic.

        **V. Output Requirements:**
            * **Format:** Provide the extracted **Date** and the determined **Time** combined into a single string in the format: **DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM** (24-hour clock). Ensure the date part reflects the day, month, and full four-digit year.
            * **If Not Found:** If the described seal is not found in the document, or if the date or time cannot be reliably determined according to the rules, return **null**.
            * **Ambiguity Note:** If a critical judgment call was necessary due to unavoidable visual ambiguity (as described in Section IV), append a brief note explaining the ambiguity and the choice made. Example: "Ambiguity: Pointer leading edge very close to major line '03'; interpreted as just past line, resulting in 03:00 rather than 02:00."

            "description": """
        **You are an expert data extraction system. Your task is to extract the Customer Request Letter Date from the document.**

        **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the specific date on which the customer (also referred to as the applicant) formally prepared and dated their request letter or application form. This is considered the authorship date of the letter by the customer.

        **Guidance for Extraction:**
        1.  **Identification Cues:**
            * **Labels:** Look for explicit labels such as 'Date:', 'Dated:', 'Letter Date:'.
            * **Location:** This date is typically found in the header section of the letter, often near the applicant's details (name, address) or below the sender's address and before the recipient's address or salutation. It can also be near the signature block if not in the header.
            * **Context:** It is the primary date associated with the creation of the letter by the customer/applicant, not necessarily dates mentioned within the body of the letter referring to other events (e.g., invoice dates, shipment dates, unless this letter *is* the invoice).
        2.  **Data Format:**
            * The date can appear in various formats (e.g., "DD-MM-YYYY", "MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY-MM-DD", "DD MON YYYY", "Month D, YYYY", "DD/MM/YY", "MM.DD.YY").
        3.  **What to Extract:**
            * Extract the complete date.
            * If the date includes a textual month name (e.g., "October"), ensure it's captured correctly.

        **Examples of potential text segments containing the date:**
        * "Date: 03-10-2023"
        * "Dated: October 3, 2023"
        * "2023-10-03"
        * "03 OCT 2023"
        * "22/12/2023"

        **Output Requirements:**
        * **Format:** Standardize and return the extracted date in **DD-MM-YYYY** format. For example, if "October 3, 2023" is found, output "03-10-2023". If "2023/10/03" is found, output "03-10-2023". If "22/12/23" is found, output "22-12-2023".
        * **If Not Found:** If the Customer Request Letter Date cannot be clearly identified or is absent from the document, return **null**.
        * **Clarification:** Distinguish this from other dates like 'Date of Receipt' or 'Invoice Date' unless the document structure clearly indicates this is the primary letter date.

        **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the beneficiary's bank account number or International Bank Account Number (IBAN) where the funds are to be credited.

        **Guidance for Extraction:**
        1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Labels:** Look for labels such as 'Account No.:', 'A/C No.:', 'Account Number:', 'Beneficiary Account No.:', 'IBAN:', 'Beneficiary IBAN:', 'Acc No:', 'A/c ID:'.
        * **Location:** This information is typically found within the 'Beneficiary Details' or 'Beneficiary Bank Details' section, often close to the beneficiary's name and bank name.
        * **Format:**
            * **Account Numbers** vary widely in format (can be numeric, alphanumeric, may contain hyphens or spaces).
            * **IBANs** have a specific structure: they start with a two-letter country code, followed by two check digits, and then a country-specific Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) which can be up to 30 alphanumeric characters (e.g., DE89370400440532013000, GB29NWBK60161331926819).
        2.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the **complete and exact account number or IBAN** as it appears.
        * Include all alphanumeric characters and any embedded hyphens or spaces if they are part of the presented number (though it's common to normalize by removing spaces/hyphens later). For extraction, capture as presented.
        * If both an IBAN and a local account number are present for the beneficiary, output the IBAN and NOT Account Number.

        **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
        1.  **IBAN Identification:** An IBAN typically starts with a two-letter country code (e.g., 'IT' for Italy, 'DE' for Germany, 'GB' for Great Britain) followed by check digits and the basic bank account number. Ensure the extracted value matches this structure and is labeled as IBAN.
        2.  **Specificity:** Only extract the value if it is explicitly identified as an IBAN. Do not extract other account numbers for this field.
        3.  **Accuracy:** If an IBAN is found, ensure precise extraction, including all alphanumeric characters.
        4.  **OCR Imperfections:** IBANs are alphanumeric and can be misread by OCR (e.g., '0' vs 'O', 'I' vs 'L', '5' vs 'S'). Interpret carefully.
        5.  **Absence:** If no IBAN is explicitly stated or identifiable, this field should extract account number.

        **Examples of Account No / IBAN text:**
        * "IBAN: DE89370400440532013000"
        * "Account No.: 001-234567-890"

    **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the full official name of the bank where the beneficiary holds their account, primarily from a structured table.

    **Guidance for Extraction:**
    1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Primary Label and Location:** Look for a section or row in a table, typically labeled something like **'(A)Beneficiary Bank ACCOUNT NO Beneficiary Bank name, address& Wire details'** or simply **'Beneficiary Bank name, address& Wire details'**.
        * **Other Labels:** Also consider general labels such as 'Beneficiary Bank:', 'Bank Name:', 'Beneficiary's Bank:', 'Receiving Bank:', 'Payee Bank:'.

        **Objective:** Accurately locate and return an 11-character alphanumeric string representing the Beneficiary Bank's SWIFT/BIC code.  Handle diacritics by converting them to their closest English alphabet equivalent. If a valid 11-character SWIFT code (after diacritic conversion) is not found, extract other bank identifiers (IFSC, Sort Code, BSB, ABA) and indicate the type of code extracted.

        **Guidance for Extraction:**

        1. **Priority: SWIFT Code:** First, search for a SWIFT/BIC code. Look for labels such as 'SWIFT Code:', 'BIC Code:', 'SWIFT/BIC:', 'Beneficiary Bank SWIFT:'. The code will be 8 or 11 characters.  If an 8-character code is found, append 'XXX' to reach 11 characters.

        2. **Diacritic Conversion:** If the extracted SWIFT code contains diacritics (e.g., accents), convert them to their closest English alphabet equivalent (e.g., 'é' to 'e', 'ü' to 'u').  Use a simple, character-by-character substitution. Do not use advanced transliteration techniques.

        3. **Validation:** After diacritic conversion, validate that the result is an 11-character alphanumeric string. If not, proceed to step 4.

        4. **Alternative Identifiers:** If no valid SWIFT code is found after diacritic conversion, search for alternative bank identifiers: IFSC, Sort Code, BSB Number, Routing Number/ABA Number. Use the same labeling conventions and format validations as in the previous prompt (see previous prompt for details). Choose the first valid identifier found.

        5. **Format and Validation:** After extraction, validate the length and character type (alphanumeric for SWIFT/BIC, numeric for others). If the extracted identifier is invalid for its respective type, return "null".

        6. **What to Extract:** Return an 11-character alphanumeric string if a SWIFT code is found (padded and converted as necessary). Otherwise, return the first valid alternative identifier found (IFSC, Sort Code, BSB, ABA), including the type of code (e.g., "IFSC: HDFC0000123").

        7. **Output Format:** If a valid 11-character SWIFT code (after diacritic conversion) is found, return the code as a string. If no valid SWIFT code is found, return the first valid alternative identifier and its type. If no valid code of any type is found, return "null".

        **Examples:**
            * "SWIFT Code: BKCHCNBjø" -> "BKCHCNBJXXX" (diacritic removed and padded to 11 characters)

    **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the full text of any standard clauses, undertakings, legal statements, or compliance declarations made by the applicant (customer) within the request letter. These declarations often pertain to regulatory compliance (e.g., FEMA, AML, OFAC), the nature/purpose of the transaction, or affirmations of applicant responsibility.

    **Guidance for Extraction:**
    1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Section Headers:** Look for specific section titles such as 'Declarations:', 'Undertakings:', 'Applicant's Declaration:', 'Terms and Conditions:', 'FEMA Declaration:', 'Compliance Statement:', 'Customer Declarations'.
        * **Structure:** Declarations are often presented as:
            * Numbered or bulleted lists of statements (e.g., using Roman numerals (I), (II), (III) or Arabic numerals 1., 2., 3.).
            * Paragraphs of formal text, typically located towards the end of the document, often preceding the applicant's signature block.
        * **Keywords within the text:** Phrases like "I/We declare...", "We confirm...", "It is undertaken...", "This transaction complies with...", "As per FEMA guidelines...", "AML compliant...", "We certify that...", "We agree..." can indicate declaration content.
    2.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the **full and complete text** of all relevant declaration clauses or statements.
        * If there are multiple distinct declarations (e.g., under different subheadings or numbered points), concatenate them ensuring all are captured. It is crucial to capture all such statements.
        * Include all sub-points or complete paragraphs that form part of a declaration.
    3.  **Scope:**
        * Focus on declarations made *by the applicant*. Do not extract general bank terms and conditions unless they are explicitly part of an applicant's signed declaration section.
        * This refers to statements that assert something or commit the applicant to certain conditions or acknowledgements related to the specific transaction or regulatory compliance.

    **Example of text segments to look for (these are indicative, the actual text will vary):**
    * "I/We declare that this transaction complies with all applicable regulations including FEMA, 1999."
    * "We undertake that we shall make physical import within 6 months from the date of remittance..."
    * "The purpose of this remittance is [purpose], and the information provided is true and correct."
    * "FATF Declaration (if applicable): We are aware that the above remittance is being made to a FATF listed country..."
    * Numbered lists under a 'Declarations' or 'Customer Declarations' heading.

    **Output Requirements:**
    * **Format:** Return the extracted declarations as a **single multi-line string**, preserving the general structure (like paragraph breaks and list formatting if simple) as much as possible.
    * **If Not Found:** If no such standard declarations by the applicant are found, return **null**.
    * **Completeness:** Aim to capture all text that clearly forms part of the applicant's declarations. If a declaration section is extensive, extract all of it.

    1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Labels:** Look for labels such as 'Goods description and HS classification code', 'HS Code:', 'HSN Code:', 'Tariff Code:', 'Customs Code:', 'HS Classification Code:'.
        * **Location:** Usually found in relation to the 'Description of Goods' or 'Type of Goods', or in a table detailing the products.
        * **Format:** HS codes are typically 6 to 8 digits, sometimes more with national subdivisions. They can be presented as a continuous string of digits or with punctuation like periods (e.g., "1234.56.78").
        * **HS Codes could be handwritten.
    2.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the **HS code digits**.
        * If there are multiple HS codes listed for different goods, extract all of them. They can be returned as a comma-separated string or an array if multiple are clearly distinct.
        * Remove any surrounding descriptive text or labels.

    **Examples of HS Code text:**
    * "HS Code: 69072300" (Extract "69072300")
    * "HSN Code: 8517.62.00" (Extract "85176200" or "8517.62.00" - clarify desired normalization of punctuation)
    * "Tariff Code: 900130" (Extract "900130")

    **Output Requirements:**
    * **Format:** Return the extracted HS code(s) as a **string**. If multiple codes are found, they can be concatenated with a comma and space (e.g., "69072300, 85176200"). Digits only is preferred, so "8517.62.00" should become "85176200".
    * **If Not Found:** If no HS Code is found, return **null**.

        **You are an expert data extraction system. Your task is to determine the Type of Goods ('Raw Material' or 'Capital Goods') from the sentence following the letterhead, handling potential noise from stamps or markings.**

        **Objective:** Accurately determine whether the goods are classified as 'Raw Material' or 'Capital Goods'.

        **Guidance for Extraction - Decision Logic:**

        1. **Locate the Anchor Sentence:** Find the sentence containing "We wish to make an advance/direct payment towards import of XXXX (Goods/services) as part of our Raw Material/Capital Goods requirements" or similar wording.  This sentence will be located below the letterhead.

        2. **Handle Noise:** The sentence might contain stamps or other markings.  Ignore these extraneous markings when determining the type of goods.  Focus on the textual content of 'Raw Material' and 'Capital Goods'.

        3. **Primary Rule: Check for Strikethroughs:** Examine both 'Raw Material' and 'Capital Goods'. If one is struck through or clearly marked as not selected, the other option is selected.

        4. **Secondary Rule: Check for Positive Marks:** If neither option is struck through, look for positive selection marks (✓, X, *, •) directly above or adjacent to either 'Raw Material' or 'Capital Goods'. The option with a positive mark is selected.

        5. **Default Rule:** If no strikethroughs or positive marks are found, default to 'Raw Material'.

        6. **Strict Options:** Only 'Raw Material' or 'Capital Goods' are valid outputs.

        **Examples:**
            * "...as part of our Raw Material/~~Capital Goods~~..." -> "Raw Material" (Capital Goods is struck through)
            * "...as part of our [✓]Raw Material/Capital Goods..." -> "Raw Material" (Positive mark on Raw Material)
            * "...as part of our Raw Material/Capital Goods..." -> "Raw Material" (Default rule)

        **Output Requirements:**
            * **Format:** Return the determined type as a string ("Raw Material" or "Capital Goods").
            * **If Not Found:** If the anchor sentence cannot be found, return "null".

        **Objective:** Accurately locate and extract the bank account number from which the principal transaction funds will be debited, ensuring the extracted number meets IBAN standards and has a plausible digit count.

        **Guidance for Extraction:**

        1. **Identification Cues:** Look for labels like 'Account to be debited as applicable', 'Debit Account No.:', 'Account to be Debited:', or similar terms.  The account number is often preceded by 'INR A/C No:', 'A/C No:', or similar prefixes.  Locate this within the payment instruction table, associated with the applicant/customer. This is the source account for the main remittance amount, not for bank charges.

        2. **High-Fidelity Digit Extraction:** Capture *every* digit exactly as it appears, including repetitions (e.g., '00', '777'). Do not collapse or modify the sequence of digits.

        3. **IBAN Validation:** After extracting the digits, check if it conforms to IBAN standards for the relevant country (India in this case).  If it does not, return "null."  Note:  Basic length checks are not sufficient for IBAN validation; consult a relevant IBAN validation library or tool.

        1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Labels:** Look for labels specifically indicating an account for charges, such as 'Account to be debited for charges ', 'Fee Account No.:', 'Charges Account:', 'Account for Charges:' or similar such verbatim .
        * **Location:** Often found near the main debit account information or in a section discussing bank charges.
        * **Context:** The key is that this account is *specifically designated for fees* and is potentially different from the account debited for the remittance amount.
        2.  **What to Extract:**
        * Extract the **complete and exact account number** if a separate account for fees is explicitly mentioned.
        * If the document indicates fees are to be debited from the same account as the principal, or if no separate fee account is mentioned, this field should reflect that (e.g., by being null or by instruction).
        * Example context: "Account to be debited for charges of HDFC Bank Ltd. on us a/c no 50200040555100". Here, 50200040555100 is the fee account.


        3. **Primary Location and Logic:** Find the row labeled ""Account to be debited for charges of HDFC Bank Ltd."" or similar.
        4. **"on us" Condition:** If ""on us"" is selected (indicated by a mark or text like ""(YES) on us""), and an account number is explicitly provided, extract that number.

        **You are an expert data extraction and validation system.** Your primary task is to accurately locate and extract the Dispatch Port (Port of Loading) from the provided multi-page document.

        **Objective:** Extract the name of the port, airport, or place from where the goods are to be dispatched or shipped (also known as Port of Loading). Multiple pages may contain relevant information.

        **Guidance for Extraction and Confidence Handling:**

        1.  **Identification Cues:**
            * Thoroughly scan for labels such as 'Port of Despatch:', 'Port of Dispatch:', 'Port of Loading:', 'From Port:', 'Shipped From:', 'Origin Port:', 'Name of the shipping company / airlines', 'Port of Despatch', 'Loading Port', 'Departure Port', or any similar contextual phrase indicating the point of origin for shipment.

        4.  **Multi-Page Processing:**
            * The information may reside on one or more of the provided documents. Process all pages comprehensively.

        5.  **Confidence-Based Validation & Re-checking:**
            * **Initial Extraction:** Perform an initial extraction attempt using the identification cues.
            * **Confidence Assessment:** If the confidence score for the extracted value is low (as determined by the underlying OCR engine's confidence metric), or if the extracted value seems ambiguous/unusual (e.g., contains numbers, unexpected characters, or is too short/long to be a port name):
                * **Re-scan:** Re-scan the immediate vicinity of the identified cue using a slightly broader search window or more flexible pattern.
                * **Cross-reference:** Look for corroborating information in other sections or pages of the document that might mention shipping origins or specific ports.
                * **Contextual Validation:** Check if the extracted value makes sense as a port name in a geographical context (e.g., is it a known city or port?). While direct lookup isn't possible for me, prioritize values that *look* like valid locations over random characters.
                * **Prioritization:** If multiple candidates are found, prioritize the one with the highest confidence score and the most direct association with an 'Identification Cue'.

        6.  **Ambiguity Resolution:**
            * If multiple possible ports are identified, prioritize those with clear labeling or strong contextual clues suggesting a port of origin for the goods. If truly ambiguous and multiple valid ports of origin are present (e.g., for different items in a consolidated shipment), return a comma-separated list.

        **Examples of Dispatch Port text:**

        **You are an expert data extraction system. Your task is to extract who bears the Foreign Bank Charges by applying a strict set of rules.**

        **Objective:** Accurately determine who is responsible for foreign bank charges and represent the choice as a one-letter code: 'O' (Beneficiary) or 'U' (Applicant/Remitter).

        **Guidance for Extraction - Decision Logic:**

        1.  **Locate Options:** First, find the section for "Foreign Bank Charges" and identify the options, such as 'on us', 'on beneficiary', 'OUR', or 'BEN'.

        2.  **Primary Rule: Check for a Cutout:**
            * Inspect both options to see if one is cut out or struck through.
            * If one option is struck out, the **other option** is ALWAYS the selected one. Proceed to Step 5 (Map to Code).

        3.  **Secondary Rule: Check for Positive Marks:**
            * If and only if NEITHER option is cut out, look for a positive selection mark next to an option.
            * **Positive Selection Marks:** A tick mark (✓), 'X', star (*), or dot (•).
            * The option associated with the mark is the selected one. Proceed to Step 5 (Map to Code).

        4.  **Default Rule:**
            * If no selection can be made from the rules above (no cutout and no positive marks), the default selection is 'on beneficiary'.

        5.  **Map to Code:** After determining the selected text, convert it to the final one-letter code:
            * **'on us'** or **'OUR'** -> maps to **'U'**
            * **'on beneficiary'** or **'BEN'** -> maps to **'O'**
            * **'on Full'** or **'BEN'** -> maps to **'U'**

        **Examples of the Full Logic:**
        * **Source (Cutout Rule):** `Charges: ~~on us~~ () on beneficiary` -> 'on beneficiary' is selected -> **Extract 'O'**.
        * **Source (Positive Mark Rule):** `Charges: () on us ☑ on beneficiary` -> 'on beneficiary' is selected -> **Extract 'O'**.

This information must be explicitly stated or directly referenced *within the text of the CRL itself*.

            **Guidance for Extraction:**
            1.  **Source Focus:**
                * The invoice number must be found *within the content of the Customer Request Letter*. Do not infer it from other documents or assume it based on file names or references to attachments not directly quoted in the CRL text.

            2.  **Identification Cues within the CRL:**

                * **Contextual Phrases:** The invoice number might also follow phrases like "payment for invoice...", "remittance against...", "related to invoice...", "as per PI...".
                * **Location:** This reference is typically found in sections detailing the purpose of the payment, description of goods/services, or in specific fields/boxes designated for invoice details within the CRL. Pay particular attention to:
                    * Boxes or sections with headers like "special ref no to be mentioned in swift" (the invoice number may be this special reference number or listed within this box).
                    * Sections titled or related to "Shipment details & Proforma Invoice details mandatory for advance import " or similar phrasing indicating invoice information.
                * **Format (on document):** The invoice number as it appears on the document is commonly alphanumeric and can include characters like hyphens (-), slashes (/), periods (.), and spaces. It is an identifier issued by the beneficiary/exporter on their invoice.

            3.  **What to Extract:**
                * Extract the **complete and exact invoice number** precisely as it is referenced in the CRL. (The removal of hyphens is handled in the output formatting stage).

            * **Format:** Return the extracted invoice number as a single **string**. Any hyphens (-) present in the identified invoice number should be removed from the final returned string. Other special characters (e.g., slashes (/), periods (.)) should be preserved as they appear in the source text.
            * **Multiple References Consideration:** If the CRL could explicitly list multiple distinct invoice numbers for a single remittance item and the requirement is to extract only one, prioritize the first one clearly labeled or referenced. If all distinct invoice numbers pertaining to the request need to be captured, this prompt might need adjustment for list output. (Current prompt targets a single, primary reference).
            * **If Not Found:** If no invoice number is explicitly referenced in the CRL text itself, return **null**.
            * **Avoid Inference:** If an invoice is mentioned merely as an attachment (e.g., "see attached invoice") but its number is not quoted or directly referenced in the CRL's text, this should also result in **null** for this field.

    **Guidance for Extraction:**
    1.  **Identification Cues:**
        * **Document Title/Purpose:** The overall nature of the document (e.g., "Request Letter for Import Payment", "Application for Remittance") is a strong indicator.
        * **Explicit Statements:** Look for phrases like "We wish to make an advance payment...", "Request you to process the Import remittance...", "Application for issuance of...".
        * **Context:** For a Customer Request Letter (CRL) concerning payments, the event is generally related to payment initiation or instruction.
    2.  **What to Extract:**
        * A concise description of the transaction event.
        * This field is often implicitly defined by the document type but look for explicit phrasing.

            **Guidelines for Identification:**
            1.  **Letterhead Priority:** The company name displayed prominently in the invoice header or letterhead is usually the seller.
            2.  **Legal Entity:** Prioritize the name that includes a legal suffix (e.g., Ltd, Inc., LLC, Pvt. Ltd) if available, as this often denotes the full legal name.

                * If the letterhead presents a name like 'Trading Name, A Unit of Legal Entity Ltd' or 'Operating Division, Division of Parent Company Inc.', the 'Legal Entity Ltd' or 'Parent Company Inc.' is generally preferred as the full legal name.
                * However, if 'Trading Name' itself is listed as the 'Beneficiary' for payments and appears to operate as the primary invoicing entity, it may be considered. For consistency, prefer the parent legal entity if clearly stated.

            * **OCR Imperfections:** Text from letterheads or logos can sometimes be stylized. Interpret carefully, watching for misrecognized characters.
            * **Completeness:** Ensure the full name, including any legal suffixes (Ltd., Inc., etc.), is captured if it's part of the identified legal name.

            The country is typically the last component of the seller's full address or may be explicitly labeled (e.g., 'Country: TANZANIA'). It's often found in the invoice header near the seller's name and address.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **OCR Imperfections:** The country name, especially if part of a long address line, might be subject to OCR errors. Interpret common country names even if slightly misspelled (e.g., 'Tanzana' should be recognized as 'TANZANIA').
            2.  **Address Structure:** Focus on the last distinct geographical entity in the seller's address block.
            3.  **Inference (USA Specific):** For US addresses, the country "USA" might be inferred from state abbreviations (e.g., 'IN' for Indiana, 'IL' for Illinois implies USA). For other countries, the name is usually explicit.
            4.  **Readability Issues:** If the country name is significantly garbled, use contextual clues from the city or other address parts if possible.

            **Output Format:**
            Extract the country name as a single string (e.g., 'TANZANIA', 'INDIA', 'USA').

            **Example (from the provided document context):**
            The seller's address in the header concludes with 'TANZANIA'. Therefore, the seller country is 'TANZANIA'.

            **Typical Location & Labels:**
            Currency information is often found next to monetary values (especially totals or line item amounts), in column headers of financial tables (e.g., 'Amount USD', 'Price EUR'), or explicitly stated (e.g., 'All amounts in USD'). Look for currency symbols (e.g., $, €, £) or standard currency codes (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, INR).

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Explicit Codes vs. Symbols:** Prioritize explicit currency codes (like 'USD', 'EUR') if present. If only symbols are found (like '$'), infer the most likely currency based on context (e.g., '$' on an invoice from a US seller often implies USD, but could be CAD, AUD, etc., so explicit codes are better).
            2.  **Consistency:** Check if the currency is consistently used across multiple monetary fields (line items, totals, payment terms).
            3.  **OCR Imperfections:** Currency codes or symbols might be misread. 'USO' might be 'USD', 'EUR0' might be 'EUR'.
            4.  **Absence:** If no currency symbol or code is clearly associated with the main financial amounts, this field might be indeterminable from the visual data alone.

            **Typical Location & Labels:**
            Look for amounts associated with labels like 'Total', 'Subtotal', 'Net Amount', 'Invoice Total', 'Amount Due before Tax'. It's crucial to distinguish this from individual line item amounts if an overall total for the goods/services is present. This value should be numerical.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Clarity of 'Total':** Identify the most significant sum representing the value of the invoiced items/services. On some invoices, multiple totals exist (e.g., Subtotal, Tax, Grand Total). This field aims for the main sum of the goods/services themselves, which might be a subtotal before other charges, or the grand total if the structure is simple.
            2.  **Numerical Value Only:** Extract only the numerical value. Do not include currency symbols or codes in this specific field output. Ensure correct parsing of thousands separators (commas) and decimal points if present (e.g., '212,800.00' should be extracted as '212800.00' or '212800').
            3.  **OCR Imperfections:** Numbers are prone to OCR errors (e.g., '1' vs '7', '0' vs '8'). Validate against calculations if possible (e.g., quantity * rate).
            4.  **Distinction from other totals:** If 'Grand Total' or 'Total Amount Due' is very distinct and appears to be a final calculation after this sum, this field should capture the sum *before* those final adjustments if it's clearly presented. In simpler invoices, this might be the only total.

            **Output Format:**
            Extract the numerical value as a string, ideally cleaned of currency symbols and non-essential formatting (e.g., '212800', '1500.75').

            **Example (from the provided document context):**
            The 'Description of Goods' table shows a 'TOTAL AMOUNT' of '212800'. This represents the sum of the invoiced goods.

        * Extract the **complete and exact account number or IBAN** as it appears.
        * Include all alphanumeric characters and any embedded hyphens or spaces if they are part of the presented number (though it's common to normalize by removing spaces/hyphens later). For extraction, capture as presented.
        * If both an IBAN and account number are present for the beneficiary, output the IBAN and NOT Account Number.

        **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
        1.  **IBAN Identification:** An IBAN typically starts with a two-letter country code (e.g., 'IT' for Italy, 'DE' for Germany, 'GB' for Great Britain) followed by check digits and the basic bank account number. Ensure the extracted value matches this structure and is labeled as IBAN.
        2.  **Specificity:** Only extract the value if it is explicitly identified as an IBAN. Do not extract other account numbers for this field.
        3.  **Accuracy:** If an IBAN is found, ensure precise extraction, including all alphanumeric characters.
        4.  **OCR Imperfections:** IBANs are alphanumeric and can be misread by OCR (e.g., '0' vs 'O', 'I' vs 'L', '5' vs 'S'). Interpret carefully.
        5.  **Absence:** If no IBAN is explicitly stated or identifiable, this field should extract account number.

        3.  **Data Cleaning and Intelligent Repair:**
            * **Repair with Confidence:** Use the strict ISO 9362 rules to fix common OCR errors (e.g., '8' -> 'B', '5' -> 'S').
                * *Example:* If OCR reads `BSAB3SBB`, recognize the 5th character (Country Code) must be a letter and repair it to `BSABESBB`.
            * **Diacritic Conversion:** Convert any diacritics (e.g., é, ñ) to standard English letters (e.g., e, n).

        4.  **Final Output Formatting and Normalization (New Rule):**
            * The final output string must contain **only the code itself**, stripped of all labels.
            * **Length Normalization:**
                * If the validated code is **8 characters** long, you **MUST append 'XXX'** to the end to create a standard 11-character code.
                * If the validated code is already **11 characters** long, return it as is.

        **Examples of Logic:**
        * **Source Text:** "SWIFT: DEUTDEFF" -> Validate to `DEUTDEFF` (8 chars) -> Normalize to `DEUTDEFFXXX`
        * **Source Text:** "BIC Code: NWBKGB2LXXX" -> Validate to `NWBKGB2LXXX` (11 chars) -> Return `NWBKGB2LXXX`
        * **Source Text:** "SWIFT: BSABESBBXXX" -> Validate to `BSABESBBXXX` (11 chars) -> Return `BSABESBBXXX`

        5.  **Fallback Strategy:**
            * If, and only if, you can determine with high certainty that no SWIFT/BIC code is present, extract another valid bank identifier (e.g., IFSC, ABA). Do not apply normalization rules to these fallback codes.

        **Output Requirements:**
        * **Format:** Return the cleaned, validated, and normalized SWIFT/BIC code as a **single string** of 11 characters.
        * **If Not Found:** If no valid bank identifier can be found after applying all rules, return **null**.

            Look for columns labeled 'Description', 'Description of Goods', 'Item Description', 'Details', or similar within the line items table.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Multiple Items:** If there are multiple line items, extract the description for each.
            2.  **Multi-line Descriptions:** Individual item descriptions may span multiple lines. Capture all relevant descriptive text, preserving internal line breaks if they add clarity.
            3.  **Concatenation/Formatting:** Combine descriptions from all line items into a single string. Use a clear separator (e.g., a double newline '\\n\\n' or a specific marker like 'ITEM_SEPARATOR') between the descriptions of distinct items or POs if not itemizing.
            4.  **Completeness vs. Summary:** Extract all relevant descriptive text for each line item. Summarize only if the list is exceptionally long and a summary is explicitly allowed. For most cases, full descriptions are preferred.
            5.  **OCR Imperfections:** Descriptions can contain alphanumeric codes, special characters, and mixed case text, which can be prone to OCR errors. Interpret carefully.

            **Output Format:**
            Extract as a single string. For multiple items, concatenate their descriptions, preserving internal newlines and using a consistent separator (e.g., '\\n\\n') between descriptions of different items.

            **Example (from the `INVOICE.pdf` context):**
            The invoice lists descriptions for three POs/items. The extracted string should combine these, for instance:

            1.  **Multiple Items:** If there are multiple line items, extract the quantity for each.
            2.  **Units of Measure:** If a unit of measure (e.g., PC, KG, EA, HRS, M, LBS) is specified alongside the quantity, include it.
            3.  **Concatenation/Formatting:** For multiple items, list each quantity and its unit. Combine these into a single string using a clear separator (e.g., a semicolon '; ' or newline '\\n').
            4.  **Numerical Accuracy:** Ensure quantities are extracted accurately as numbers.

            1.  **Completeness:** Capture the full text of the payment terms as stated. This can include percentages, due dates relative to an event (e.g., 'Net 30 days', 'Due Upon Receipt'), or specific conditions like 'Letter of Credit'.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Nature of Signature:** Determine if it's a handwritten signature (often an image, may be described as 'Signature present'), a digital signature mark, or a typed name of an individual authorized to sign. A typed company name in a footer is generally not considered a signature for this purpose unless explicitly stated as 'Authorized by [Company Name]'.

            The `INVOICE.pdf` does not show a clear handwritten signature or a typed name of an individual acting as an authorized signatory for La Marzocco Srl. While the company name "La Marzocco Srl" appears at the bottom, it serves more as company identification in the footer rather than a specific authorization signature by an individual.

            **Important Considerations for Extraction:**
            1.  **Nature of Signature:** Determine if it's a handwritten signature, a digital signature mark, or a typed name of an individual clearly indicating acceptance or authorization on behalf of the buyer. A typed company name alone is generally not a signature unless part of an explicit acceptance statement.
            2.  **Context of Acceptance:** The signature should ideally signify the buyer's acknowledgment or acceptance of the invoice terms or order.
            3.  **Presence:** This field is often not present on standard invoices. If not found, it should be 'null'. If a signature image is present but unreadable, "Signature present" might be appropriate. If a typed name (of an individual) acts as authorization, extract that name.

CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
**Task:** You are an AI Document Classification Specialist. Your objective is to meticulously analyze the provided document pages ({num_pages} pages) and accurately classify the document's primary type based on its intrinsic purpose, structural characteristics, and specific content elements. The document may consist of multiple pages that collectively form a single logical entity.

**Acceptable Document Types:**
{acceptable_types_str}
Strictly classify the document ONLY amongst the acceptable document types.

**Detailed Instructions for Classification:**

1.  **Holistic Review:** Conduct a comprehensive examination of all pages. Pay close attention to titles, headings, recurring phrases, specific keywords (see below), data tables (e.g., itemized goods, payment details), and the overall layout to discern the document's fundamental function.
2.  **Content and Keyword Analysis (Prioritize explicit titles and document structure):**
    * **INVOICE (Commercial, Proforma, Customs):**
        * **Primary Keywords/Titles:** Search for explicit titles like "Invoice", "Commercial Invoice", "Proforma Invoice", "Tax Invoice", "Customs Invoice", "Proforma", "PI".
        * **Supporting Keywords/Phrases:** "Fattura" (Italian), "Rechnung" (German), "Facture" (French), "Bill", "Statement of Charges". Documents titled "Order Confirmation", "Sales Contract", "Sales Order", "Sales Agreement", "Indent", "PO", "Purchase Order" can function as a **Proforma Invoice** if they provide full itemization, pricing, terms, and are used to initiate payment or L/C.
        * **Core Structural Elements:**
            * A unique "Invoice Number" or "Reference Number".
            * Clear identification of "Seller" (or "Shipper", "Exporter", "Beneficiary", "From") and "Buyer" (or "Consignee", "Importer", "Bill To", "To") with names and addresses.
            * Itemized list of goods or services: descriptions, quantities, unit prices, line totals.
            * A "Total Amount Due", "Grand Total", or similar aggregate financial sum.
            * An "Invoice Date" or "Date of Issue" (a Proforma might use an "Order Date" or "Proforma Date").
            * Payment terms (e.g., "Net 30", "Advance Payment") and often bank details for payment.
        * **Differentiation:**
            * **Commercial Invoice:** Typically a definitive bill for goods already shipped or services rendered; requests payment for a completed transaction part.
            * **Proforma Invoice:** A preliminary quotation or bill issued *before* goods shipment or service completion. Used for buyer to arrange financing (like L/C), make a prepayment, or for customs pre-clearance. Often explicitly titled "Proforma Invoice".
            * **Customs Invoice:** Specifically formatted for customs authorities, detailing goods for import/export, including values, HS codes, country of origin, package details, for duty assessment.
    * **CRL (Customer Request Letter) / Application:**
        * **Primary Keywords/Titles:** "Request Letter", "Application for [Bank Product/Service]", "Letter of Instruction", "Remittance Application", "Import Payment Request".
        * **Supporting Keywords/Phrases:** Addressed "To The Manager, [Bank Name]", phrases like "We request you to...", "Kindly process the remittance for...", "Please debit our account...", "Letter of Undertaking".
        * **Content Focus:** Formal, written instruction from a customer (Applicant) to their bank. Explicitly requests the bank to perform a financial transaction (e.g., "issue a Letter of Credit", "remit funds for import", "process an outward remittance", "make an advance payment"). Contains details of the transaction: amount, currency, purpose, beneficiary name and bank details. Applicant's account to be debited is usually specified. Often includes declarations and signature of the applicant.
        * **Parties:** Clearly identifies an "Applicant" (customer) and a "Beneficiary" (recipient of funds).
3.  **Primary Purpose Determination:** Based on the collective evidence from all pages (explicit titles being a strong indicator), the presence/absence of key fields, and the characteristic markers outlined above, ascertain which single "Acceptable Document Type" most accurately represents the *overall primary purpose* of the document. What is the document's core function or the action it is intended to facilitate?
4.  **Confidence Assessment:** Assign a confidence score based on the clarity and preponderance of evidence.
    * **High Confidence (0.90-1.00):** An explicit, unambiguous title matching an acceptable type (e.g., "COMMERCIAL INVOICE") AND the presence of most core fields/structural elements characteristic of that type. The document's purpose is very clear.
    * **Medium Confidence (0.70-0.89):** The title might be generic (e.g., just "INVOICE" where it could be Commercial or Proforma) or the type is inferred (e.g., a Purchase Order acting as a Proforma Invoice based on its content). Core fields and structure strongly suggest a particular type, but some ambiguity or deviation exists. Or, a clear title but some expected key elements are missing or unclear.
    * **Low Confidence (0.50-0.69):** Title is ambiguous, misleading, or absent. Content could align with multiple types, or is missing several key indicators for any single type, making classification difficult.
    * **Very Low/Unknown (0.0-0.49):** Document does not appear to match any of the acceptable types based on available indicators, or is too fragmented/illegible for reliable classification.
5.  **Output Format (Strict Adherence Required):**
    * Return ONLY a single, valid JSON object.
    * The JSON object must contain exactly three keys: `"classified_type"`, `"confidence"`, and `"reasoning"`.
    * `"classified_type"`: The determined document type string. This MUST be one of the "Acceptable Document Types". If, after thorough analysis, the document does not definitively match any acceptable type based on the provided indicators, use "UNKNOWN".
    * `"confidence"`: A numerical score between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.95).
    * `"reasoning"`: A concise but specific explanation for your classification. Reference explicit titles, key terms found (or absent), presence/absence of core fields, or structural elements that led to your decision (e.g., "Document explicitly titled 'PROFORMA INVOICE' on page 1. Contains seller/buyer, itemized goods with prices, total value, and payment terms. Serves as a preliminary bill for payment initiation."). If 'UNKNOWN', explain why (e.g., "Lacks clear title and key invoice fields like invoice number or distinct buyer/seller sections. Appears to be an internal statement not matching defined types.").

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  "classified_type": "INVOICE",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "reasoning": "Document exhibits all core characteristics of a proforma invoice: details seller and buyer, lists specific goods with quantities and unit prices leading to a total amount, specifies payment terms ('50% advance...'), and indicates 'Ship Date TBD'. While not explicitly titled 'Proforma Invoice', its structure and content align perfectly with its function as a preliminary bill for initiating payment, akin to a sales order formatted for external use."

Information may be spread across multiple pages; you must synthesize all available information to find the most accurate and complete value for each field. Pay meticulous attention to nuanced instructions, including rules for differentiating between similar concepts (e.g., 'Applicant' vs. 'Beneficiary'), and apply rules for inference or default values only when explicitly permitted by the field's description.

**Fields to Extract (Name and Detailed Description):**
{field_list_str}


**Output Requirements (Strict):**

1.  **JSON Only:** You MUST return ONLY a single, valid JSON object as your response. This is a strict machine-to-machine interface; do not include any introductory text, explanations, summaries, apologies, or any other text outside of the JSON structure. Your response must begin directly with `{{` and end with `}}` to ensure seamless programmatic integration.
2.  **JSON Structure:** The JSON object MUST have keys that correspond EXACTLY to the field **names** provided in the "Fields to Extract" list. **Every single requested field must be included as a key in the output to ensure a complete and predictable structure.** Your response MUST be a perfectly valid JSON, free of any extra quotes, trailing commas, or special characters that would cause a parser to fail.STRICTLY MAKE SURE IT IS A VALID JSON WITH NO EXTRA QUOTES, COMMAS, SPECIAL CHARACTERS ETC. AND CAN BE PARSED PROGRAMATICALLY BY A PARSER.
3.  **Field Value Object:** Each value associated with a field key MUST be another JSON object containing the following three keys EXACTLY:
    * `"value"`: The extracted text value for the field.
        * If the field is clearly present, extract the value with absolute precision, ensuring every character is accurately represented and free of extraneous text/formatting (unless the formatting is part of the value, like a specific date format if ISO conversion is not possible).
        * If the field is **not found** or **not applicable** after thoroughly searching all pages and considering contextual clues as per the field description, use the JSON value `null` (not the string "null").
        * If multiple potential values exist (e.g., different addresses for a seller), select the one most pertinent to the field's specific context (e.g., 'Seller Address' for invoice issuance vs. 'Seller Corporate HQ Address' if the field specifically asks for that). Document ambiguity in reasoning.
        * For amounts, extract numerical values (e.g., "15000.75", removing currency symbols or group separators like commas unless they are part of a regional decimal format that must be preserved). Currency is typically a separate field.
        * For dates, if possible and certain, convert to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). If conversion is uncertain due to ambiguous source format (e.g., "01/02/03"), extract as it appears and note the ambiguity and original format in the reasoning.
        * For multi-line addresses, concatenate lines into a single string, typically separated by a comma and space (e.g., "123 Main St, Anytown, ST 12345, Country").

    * `"confidence"`: **Granular Character-Informed, Contextual, and Source-Aware Confidence Score (Strict)**
        * **Core Principle:** The overall confidence score (float, 0.00 to 1.00, recommend 2 decimal places) for each field MUST reflect the system's certainty about **every single character** of the extracted value, AND the **contextual correctness and verifiability** of that extraction. It's a holistic measure.
        * **Key Factors Influencing Confidence:**
            1.  **OCR Character Quality & Ambiguity:** Clarity and sharpness of each character (machine-print vs. handwriting). Low confidence for ambiguous characters (e.g., '0'/'O', '1'/'l'/'I', '5'/'S') unless context makes it near-certain.
            2.  **Handwriting Legibility:** Clarity, consistency, and formation of handwritten characters.
            3.  **Field Format Adherence:** How well the extracted value matches the expected data type and pattern (e.g., all digits for an account number, valid date structure, correct SWIFT code pattern). Deviations drastically lower confidence.
            4.  **Label Presence & Quality:** Was the value found next to a clear, standard, unambiguous label matching the field description? (e.g., "Invoice No.:" vs. inferring from a poorly labeled column). Explicit, standard labels lead to higher confidence.
            5.  **Positional Predictability:** Was the field found in a common, expected location for that document type versus an unusual one?
            6.  **Contextual Plausibility & Consistency:** Does the value make sense for the field and in relation to other extracted fields? (e.g., a 'Latest Shipment Date' should not be before an 'Order Date'). Cross-validation (e.g., amount in words vs. numeric amount) consistency is key.
            7.  **Completeness of Information:** If a field expects multiple components (e.g., full address) and parts are missing/illegible, this reduces confidence for the entire field.
            8.  **Source Document Quality:** Overall document clarity, scan quality, skew, rotation, background noise, stamps/markings obscuring text.
            9.  **Inference Level:** Was the value directly extracted or inferred? Higher degrees of inference lower confidence.

        * **Confidence Benchmarks (Stricter & More Granular):**
            * **0.99 - 1.00 (Very High/Near Certain):** Reserved for perfect, All characters perfectly clear, machine-printed text next to an explicit, standard label in a predictable location. Perfect format match. Contextually validated and sound. No plausible alternative interpretation. (Example: A clearly printed Invoice Number next to "Invoice No.:" label).
            * **0.95 - 0.98 (High):** Characters very clear and legible (excellent machine print or exceptionally neat handwriting). Minor, non-ambiguity-inducing visual imperfections. Strong label or unmistakable positional/contextual evidence. Correct format. Contextually valid. (Example: A clearly printed total amount next to "Grand Total:").
            * **0.88 - 0.94 (Good):** Generally clear, but minor, identifiable factors prevent higher scores:
                * One or two characters with slight ambiguity resolved with high confidence by context or pattern.
                * Very clean, legible, and consistent handwriting.
                * Information reliably extracted from structured tables with clear headers.
                * Minor print defects (slight fading/smudging) not obscuring character identity.
            * **0.75 - 0.87 (Moderate):** Value is legible and likely correct, but there are noticeable issues affecting certainty for some characters/segments, or some level of inference was required:
                * Moderately clear handwriting with some variability or less common letter forms.
                * Slightly blurry, pixelated, or faded print requiring careful interpretation for several characters.
                * Value inferred from contextual clues or non-standard labels with reasonable, but not absolute, certainty. (e.g., identifying a "Beneficiary Bank" from a block of payment text without an explicit label).
            * **0.60 - 0.74 (Low):** Significant uncertainty. Parts of the value are an educated guess, or the source is challenging:
                * Poor print quality (significant fading, widespread smudging, pixelation) affecting key characters.
                * Difficult or messy handwriting for a substantial portion of the value.
                * High ambiguity for several characters or critical segments where context provides only weak support. Value inferred with significant assumptions or from unclear/damaged source text.
            * **< 0.60 (Very Low / Unreliable):** Extraction is highly speculative or impossible to perform reliably. Value likely incorrect, incomplete, or based on guesswork. Text is largely illegible, critical characters are indecipherable, or contextual validation fails insurmountably.
        * If `"value"` is `null`, `None` and `nan` (field not found/applicable), `"confidence"` MUST be `0.0`.

    * `"reasoning"`: A concise but specific explanation justifying the extracted `value` and the assigned `confidence` score. This is crucial for auditability and improvement.
        * Specify *how* the information was identified (e.g., "Directly beside explicit label 'Invoice No.' on page 1.", "Inferred from the 'BILL TO:' address block on page 2 as buyer's name.", "Calculated sum of all line item totals from table on page 3.").
        * Indicate *where* it was found (e.g., "Page 1, top right section.", "Page 3, under table column 'Description'.", "Page 5, section titled 'Payment Instructions'.").
        * **Mandatory for any confidence score below 0.99:** Briefly explain the *primary factors* leading to the reduced confidence. Reference specific issues:
            * Character ambiguity: "Value is 'INV-O012B'; Confidence 0.78: Second char 'O' could be '0', last char 'B' could be '8'; document slightly blurred in this area."
            * Print/Scan Quality: "Value '123 Main Street'; Confidence 0.85: Slight fading on 'Street', making 'S' and 't' less than perfectly sharp."
            * Handwriting: "Value 'Johnathan Doe'; Confidence 0.70: First name legible but 'Johnathan' has an unclear 'h' and 'n'; 'Doe' is clear."
            * Inference/Labeling: "Value 'Global Exporters Inc.'; Confidence 0.90: Inferred as Seller Name from prominent placement in header, no explicit 'Seller:' label."
            * Formatting Issues: "Value '15/07/2024'; Confidence 0.92: Date format DD/MM/YYYY clearly extracted; slight ink bleed around numbers."
            * Contextual Conflict: "Value for 'Net Weight' is '1500 KG', but 'Gross Weight' is '1400 KG'; Confidence 0.60 for Net Weight due to inconsistency requiring review."
        * If confidence is 0.99-1.00, reasoning can be succinct, e.g., "All characters perfectly clear, machine-printed, explicit standard label, contextually validated."
        * If `"value"` is `null`, briefly explain *why* (e.g., "No field labeled 'HS Code' or any recognizable tariff code found on any page.", "The section for 'Intermediary Bank Details' was present but explicitly marked 'Not Applicable'.").
